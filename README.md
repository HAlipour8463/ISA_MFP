# ISA_MFP

**dimacs_baisc_factors_sorted.c** is a C source code designed to extract the basic factors of a given network in DIMACS format. These basic factors include numNodes, numArcs, NetCap, maxcap, mincap, SrcAAC, SnkAAC, Src_degree, Snk_degree, AvCap, StDAC, NmBdCap, NmGdCap, PotNetExcess, PotNetDeficit, StDAvNdDg, and various other features found in the code. The extracted basic factors are then utilized by **ISAFtrExtractorPool_InitilizeTime_mod_pool.m** to extract the final features employed in the instance space analysis for MFP (see [MATILDA - MFP Instance Space Analysis](https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/problems/opt/mfp#mfp)).

**ISA.m** is the main script controlling different functions, including "ISAFtrExtractorPool_InitilizeTime_mod_pool," to generate the metadata used in the instance space analysis.


* Benchmarks used here are in DIMACS format (see http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/generators/network/).

**purifyInst.m** is the source for the instance selection algorithm, which takes the metadata generated by ISA and filters instances based on their similarity and the similarity of the algorithm's performances on them. **CVNND.m** calculates the number of instances, uniformity, and ViSA ratio for the critical set of instances returned by purifyInst.m.


CSV files serve as the metadata for MFP; **Metadata_M0.csv** represents the initial metadata, while **Metadata_M0'.csv** is the augmented metadata obtained by adding new instances to **Metadata_M0.csv**. Subsequently, **Metadata_M2.csv** results from applying the instance selection process to **Metadata_M0'.csv**. For more details on obtaining **Metadata_M0'.csv** and **Metadata_M2.csv**, we refer readers to the following paper.
