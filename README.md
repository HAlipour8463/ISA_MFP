# ISA_MFP
This repo contains source codes written in C and MATLAB to extract features of a given set of instances for the maximum flow problem (MFP) and select unbiased instances based on their feature values. The selected instances then used by the instance space analysis (ISA) to detect the impact of features on MFP algorithms' performance. 
To apply ISA, we use the toolkit provided by MATILDA (https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/) available at: https://github.com/andremun/InstanceSpace. The resulting instance space can be explored at https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/problems/opt/mfp#mfp.

* Benchmarks used here are in DIMACS format (see http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/generators/network/).
