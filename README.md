# ISA_MFP
This repo contains source codes written in MATLAB and C to extract features of the maximum flow problem (MFP). These features then used by the instance space analysis (ISA) to detect their impact on MFP algorithms' performance. 
To apply ISA on the obtained features, we use the toolkit provided by MATILDA (https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/) available at: https://github.com/andremun/InstanceSpace.

* Benchmarks used here are in DIMACS format (see http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/generators/network/).
